    "I developed an automated file sorting system using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary goal of this project was to streamline the organization of files within a cluttered folder, providing an efficient solution for file management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Folder Analysis: I started with a folder in the \"Documents\" directory that contained various file types, including CSV, PNG, JPG, and PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folder Creation: Using Python code, I created three destination folders for sorting the files based on their types, making it easier to locate and access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Sorting Logic: Leveraging conditional statements (if, if not, elif), I implemented a systematic process to identify each file's type and move it to the appropriate folder. For example, CSV files were moved to a \"CSV\" folder, while image files (PNG and JPG) went to an \"Photos\" folder, and PDF files were relocated to a \"PDFs\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation: With the system in place, the files on my computer were automatically sorted, eliminating the need for manual file organization."
